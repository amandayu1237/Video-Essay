# Video Essay

Metal water bottles have evolved from simple, reusable containers into cultural status symbols, with brands like Stanley, Hydro Flask, Owala, and Yeti shaping consumer identity. This video essay explores how marketing, social media, and peer influence have transformed these bottles into aspirational must-haves, often linked to specific lifestyles or even academic majors. By analyzing viral trends like the VSCO Girl aesthetic and the recent Stanley craze, I examine how branding influences spending habits and perceptions of sustainability. Ultimately, this project encourages viewers to rethink their own purchasing decisions and the deeper social forces behind everyday consumer trends.
